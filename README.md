# Split-it!
An expense splitting CLI program.

## Getting Started
1. Make sure you have Node installed
  - You can download it [here](https://nodejs.org/en/).
2. Install dependencies
```
  $ npm i
```
3. Build the program
  - This has to be run every time a change is made
```
  $ npm run tsc
```
4. Start the program
- If you would like to do steps 3 and 4 together, you could run `npm run tsc_start` instead. This will ensure that you have the latest build, however, it will take longer for the program to start.
```
  $ npm start
```

## Testing
Run tests:
```
  $ npm test
```
